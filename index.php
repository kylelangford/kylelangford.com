        <p>Discussing even shaping goals early in a project's life is vital to making sure everyone is
        happy and expectations are met. Not every client needs a website, look at what you

        <p>Effective design begins with an idea but is realized through process. Sites should strive

        <p>Theming Drupal sites have taught me a lot about not just creating the look but building a
        bigger picture while creating a base that can scale gracefully. Performance and ease of
        use are also critically important as website become increasingly complex and users
        more demanding.</p>
