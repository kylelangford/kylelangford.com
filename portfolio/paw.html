          <h4>Pellentesque Vehicula Ultricies</h4>

          <p>After successful redesigns of bycycling.com and guidepost.org I was excited for our next project but realized that our process at this point was unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Around 2012 the web world changed with real support for css media queries. This sent a ripple through the industry that would change how we work moving forward. We had been making incremental improvements to our process over this time. We started to intergrate RWD ideas around a similar time but it took until 2014 for our processes to really embrace this change. Many companies struggled to adjust and many were looking for guidance. As the rest of us waited for the technologicaal floor to meet our feet. A result of producing phone, tablet, desktop comps for all pages through multiple versions was part of the growing pains. This reached an apex with guideposts when at one time we had ~90 working wireframe documents.</p>

          <p>I knew moving forward that code was our answer. My proposal was to only produce 5 wireframe pages at phone/tablet/desktop. The rest of the site would be designed using a component library derived from those 5 pages. Ultimately a full working version of their site would be produced in code at a wireframe fidelity. The client would see full working version before we even technically entered the design phase (The overall process was still waterfall). This would be a huge departure from what we had done in the past. Luckily the group at PAW was supportive and interested in new ways of working.</p>

          <p>My accomplishments for this project include crafting a viable process from content > design > development that I was apart of for the entirety of the project. Designing reusable components and list styles that would be used to complete any number of pages. All of this was done from a mobile first perspective in design and in code. I was ultimately responsible for creating the sitemap, mobile priority, wireframes, and working prototype. I also produced all the frontend production code, much of which was recycled from the prototype. I still hold to this day this is the best redesign Brunello haas done.</p>

          <p>The website was dense and packed with content. We wanted to add more of the magazines editorial look and feel to the online experience. While making the site responsive and mobile first site.</p>
