          <p>My accomplishments for this project include crafting a process from design to development. I designed reusable components and list styles that were used to layout all the pages of the site. I was responsible for creating the sitemap, mobile-priority, wireframes, and working prototype. I also produced all the front-end production code, much of which was recycled from the prototype.</p>

          <p>The current website was fixed width, dense, and packed with content. We wanted to add more of the magazines editorial look and feel to the online experience. It was also important to make the site responsive and mobile-first.</p>

          <p>We started by breaking down the current site content. We wanted to simplify the site navigation as much as possible while still making content easy to find.</p>

            <div class="caption">I created this Content Inventory &mdash; to show at a block level the heirarchy of information for the page. We created a list of all possible blocks and used that to scaffold out all the page types. Types were assigned to blocks of similar functionality to display placements. </div>
          </div>

          <p>Modular Design was important to the layout of this site. I wanted to create something predictable and easy to read. It was important to our development process that the site was component based. Building in this way allowed for greater efficiency and added to the maintainability of the code.</p>

          </div>

          <p>There were approx. 30 components on the site, only about a third of those were accounted for in the initial wireframing process. The rest I derived from common list style layouts I had created previously.</p>

          <p>Producing phone, tablet, and desktop compositions for all pages was time consuming. We had to create a reusable processes.</p>

            <div class="caption">Full Fidelity Wireframe - Kyle Langford</div>
          </div>

          <p>My proposal was to only produce 5 wireframes at phone/tablet/desktop. The rest of the site would be designed using a components derived from those pages. The goal was to make a fully working version of the site in html/css/js and show it to the client. Changes would be incorporated directly into the prototype speeding up our process. This would be a huge departure from what we had done in the past. Luckily the group at PAW was supportive and interested in new ways of working.</p>

          <p>I devised a simple template system that I used to create the prototype. This made the process extremely managable and about 2000 lines of CSS were reused to start the production build. We were able to show more pages at more screen sizes than we did prevously. We ended with 41 pages made with approx 30 components with about 100 variations. </p>

          <pre><code>
$(elem).appendTo('.header-region').load("inc/header.html");
          </code></pre>

          <p>The final designs were produced by Jay Fournier and the site was built in Drupal 7 by Mike Calebrese. I did the front-end development. Below is a working version of that prototype, follow the orange dots.</p>
