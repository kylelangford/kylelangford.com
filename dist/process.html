            <code>Preface</code>
            <h3>Methodology is an important to delivering quality work time and time again. Process should not be rigid but provide direction and, when needed adapt. Think of process as a mental exercise, you want to create the conditions for success within your project. Web-based solutions can be complicated and process allows us to break it down into manageable pieces. These notes serve as a high level overview of my experiences creating websites.</h3>

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>Goals are important for me in directing focus and providing high-quality work. At the start of a project I like to come up with a list of requirements and wishes with the client. Discussing even shaping goals early in a project's life is vital to making sure everyone is happy and expectations are met. Even with self-projects goals will help focus my time and energy. It is important for goals to be measurable and to keep track of progress.</p>

            <h4>Providing Value</h4>
            <p>Value is an important concept to understand for a business and make no mistake design is a business. Evaluating the risk vs reward in a project is important in providing a return on investment for your customers money. As an expert and a partner in your clients endeavors you should strive for value in your services. Not every client needs a website, look at what you need to accomplish and how you can achieve that elegantly. This is not cutting corners but working with purpose and direction.</p>

            <h4>Salesmanship</h4>
            <p>We like to think salesmanship does not matter, and that the quality of our work will speak for itself. But in reality we need to advocate for ourselves, our work and, our accomplishments. If we don’t love and inject passion into what we are doing why should our clients. Guiding the client and engaging them so they believe in you is part of the job. Designers ask for a lot of trust from clients when engaging in work. Looking and speaking the part is half the battle; doing would be the other half. Design is utilitarian but you can not help people or be in a position to help people if you do not know how to sell yourself.</p>

            <cite>Dont take this too litterally.</cite>

            <h4>Money</h4>
            <p>Literally the worst part of this job for me and many people. I won’t expand on this much except to say:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Track your time. </li>
              <li>Get Paid.</li>
              <li>Hire an accountant. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>Communication is often an overlooked skill but may easily be the most important. Successful designers/developers are apt at communicating with teammates and clients in a timely manner. Reading between the lines and knowing what to say and when is critical to navigating customer relations. Design is a service that we provide to customers, I have found that the experience of working with you is just as important as the outcome if not more. </p>

            <h4>Iteration</h4>
            <p>Building iteration within my process is important as it naturally allows me to refine the product in the course of a project. This is a good reason for starting to code sooner. Usually the my eyes roll into the back of my head when I hear the term agile. But this is more or less the idea we want to work with.</p>

            <h4>Research is Key</h4>
            <p>Context within a project is critical to producing relevant work. You will want to become an expert on what you are working on. You may want to do your own research and solicit feedback and information to gain a better understanding and arm yourself with knowledge. Research is important for gaining the client's trust and making informed decisions. It is also important for you to come to your own conclusions and do your own leg work with any project. Taking the client verbatim is usually not a good idea. </p>

            <h4>Content Audit</h4>
            <p>I always want to find out what I am dealing with before getting started. The client may already have a web presence, marketing, analytics, branding, etc. This includes existing content for websites or whatever you may be working on. It is a good idea to take an inventory of what they client has available and what considerations you should have when planning your project. Sometimes the clients do not really have a good grasp on what they have and this can be an illuminating time for both parties. </p>

            <h4>Content Strategy</h4>
            <p>It is important to have plans for any content that needs to be produced and create a schedule for when you will have access to it. During this phase we also need to evaluate the nuances of the content. Persona will be important with building a connection with your user. The design should reflect the tone and personality of the overall message. Identifying this early on is key as you will want to deliver consistent and targeted messaging. Planning search engine strategies and accessibility considerations now will help you in the long run. You should also consider what resources your clients have available to them and what they are capable of maintaining when creating something they will need to produce content for and maintain.</p>

            <h4>Content Hierarchy</h4>
            <p>The first step in laying out a website is figuring out what you want in it. A sitemap is a great visual tool to show the hierarchy/user paths of your site. The sitemap helps me figure out how to organize this content as a whole.  The primary level of your sitemap will essentially become your navigation. Always consider how many clicks it will take to reach certain sections. I try to keep sites as shallow as possible as this prevents sites from becoming overly complicated. You will also have to prioritize your content and make some decisions as to what is truly important. This is especially true of mobile first designs where mobile priority will have some tough choices.</p>

            <h4>Perception</h4>
            <p>verəsəˈmiliˌt(y)o͞od - the appearance of being true or real. Designers create experiences, stories for the user. We may not be asking our audiences to suspend their disbelief like in film but we do try to convince the user of a certain narrative or idea. We try to create authenticity and character with pixels and language. Honesty and integrity are important in design for this reason. Design is a business but also utilitarian and we should strive to create products that are more than cash-grabs. In another sense we want to be careful not to just tell people what they want to hear. Confirmation bias will not help your designs. Transparency goes both ways.</p>

            <h4>Inspiration and Sketching</h4>
            <p>For me inspiration is drawn from the day to day. I get inspiration from sites like awwwards or stuff I see on reddit. I like to do some basic static mockups early on because I find having an overall vision for the site helps with creating the initial wireframes. I use balsamiq/illustrator/photoshop for sketching and user flows even if my deliverable is ultimately in browser. I think it's fine to deviate from your process to capture inspiration and ideas. The important part is to return to your process with your new ideas. The iteration will only make the work stronger.</p>

            <h4>Site Layout</h4>
            <p>Having the content blocked out before getting into design is critical. Keeping the client focused on one aspect of the site at a time is important to getting good feedback. Because of this I like to keep wireframes as neutral and void of design as possible when showing them to the client. The key focus here is to show the content on the page while not suggesting a particular visual direction. Wireframes are good to do in browser because it is easier show responsive layouts, update text, and link between pages. If you are smart you can reuse most of this code moving forward.</p>
            <img src="img/example-wireframe.png" />

            <h4>Moodboards</h4>
            <p>Here I want to establish the general aesthetic we will use to show the content. I like to create mood-boards in photoshop because I can iterate and experiment on design options faster. The idea here is to avoid investing a lot time in a design direction that the client will not like. What this consists of is a frankenstein page with images, design patterns, variations, and typography. They are a bit weird but they work. I like to present a few options to a client because it helps get them engaged in the design process by having them make some choices on the final outcome.</p>
            <img src="img/example-moodboard_part1.jpg" />

            <h4>Designing with Code</h4>
            <p>Designing in browser presents a lot of benefits in my opinion as does designing static mock-ups. In regards to designing systems working with codes seems a more logical approach and allows you to iterate and refine code more in the course of a project. Working in photoshop or other graphic editing programs can be a good part of the creative process. I like keeping my chops up in these programs as I frequently need to create icons, retouch photos, or create other graphical assets.</p>
            <p>That said I won’t hesitate to jump right into the code, and in my opinion the sooner the better. Design in this case happens more organically but has a more intrinsic connection to the underlying code. The rendering of the design is also more realistic in code but does present compatibility issues with rendering differences in browsers. There are other challenges such as client deliverables and reviewing work.  But, there are challenges with more traditional methods as well. It is expensive and time consuming to create and maintain high-fidelity static comps and wireframes especially on large sites where you can be seeing an impressive number of versions or changes. This sort of approach I think is required to keep costs down and stay more competitive.</p>

            <h4>Designing Systems</h4>
            <p>Modular is the key word here. Using the wireframes and the design direction from the mood-board I like to build out the piece independently. Because the moodboard does not cover everything this is not necessarily a straightforward task. This part is kind of like paint by numbers but helps me write nice modular css. Theming complex sites have taught me a lot about not just creating the look but building out the individual pieces. The nature of the cascading effect of CSS strongly influences how the individual pieces build on each other, good systems will leverage this inheritance and have nice DRY(Do Not Repeat Yourself) CSS.</p>

            <h4>Tools of the Trade</h4>
            <p>Core strengths and soft skills are important and should be cultivated. The tools in this trade evolve quickly so a desire for learning is a must. Caution with the flavor of the week software/frameworks/language; they are in abundance and while many are useful focusing on core strength will keep your skill set more relevant and help with job security.</p>

            <h4>Developing Locally </h4>
            <p>Working locally is much faster and allows for more sophisticated workflows especially when utilizing version control. I won’t go into all the reasons version control is a necessity in modern processes there is plenty of information elsewhere. But it allows you to easily backup your work, access your work and, share your work. Developing locally will save you a lot of headaches and allow you to focus on creating not troubleshooting. I will admit I am a bit behind and still use MAMP but it gets the job done. The cool way to work locally would be to use a virtual machine with vagrant and chef. This allows you to create specific servers that you can spin up and destroy with ease. You can share the makefiles and resolving dependencies between multiple developers/servers is a thing of the past.</p>

            <h4>Performance</h4>
            <p>Performance will make or break an experience. In the case of sites and apps people want almost near immediate value with very little waiting period. Sites need to account for this in their design and technology. Mobile devices and unreliable signal strength are pushing sites to be more lean. The general rule of thumb is you have 3 seconds before a user will bounce. </p>

            <h4>Testing / QA</h4>
            <p>The best testing solution I have seen outside of the actual device is browserstack. In reality having all the physical devices can be a maintenance nightmare as well as present a time sink. Browserstack provides real virtual environments to test your sites for most browsers, operating systems and, a multitude of versions for each allowing to to do very specific tests. I tend to keep to the latest versions and primary devices in my general testing but it's not unrealistic for a client/user to be running an outdated version or operating system.</p>

            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <p>Documenting your projects and internal processes is critical to building infrastructure. You can not afford to reinvent the wheel every time. In addition commenting within programs is important for the human readability of your code and helps when multiple developers are working on a project. It could even help jog your memory when working on multiple projects or working on something you have not touched in awhile. There are a lot of ways to do this the important part is that you do it.</p>

            <h4>Upkeep</h4>
            <p>Once the site goes live it will slowly mature like a fine wine, ultimately crushed by the gravity of its own weight. The truth is sites have a life span. The nature of development cycles will leave your initial masterpiece hurting after a year or two. Upkeep and good practices are a constant struggle. Not all jobs will be glamorous, sometimes work just needs to get done. All sites reach a breaking point but hey… now you have another job.  </p>
