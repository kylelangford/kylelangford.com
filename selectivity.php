            <h3><code>Hello!</code> This is a brief overview of my creative process. This is the mojo, the magic sauce… what makes it all happen. A carefully crafted methodology is an important aspect to our craft. Process allows us to apply our trade to many industries and projects of all shapes and sizes. It is a way of problem solving which when followed whole-heartedly should yield amazing results. The contents that follow are a living document, process is something that evolves. </h3>

            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <p>At the start of any project I like to come up with a list of needs and wants. Discussing goals with the client is vital to making sure expectations are understood and met. This process is often called requirements gathering or discovery and is used to help create budgets, proposals, and quotes for clients as well as guide you along your creative process. What I hate hearing at this point is. 'I need you to make this website for me’. My pipe dream of a request would be "I have this great idea, how do I go about sharing that to the world. I would really love your input and I want to pay you with real money." But of course this is a huge responsibility and if they are investing in you, then you have to deliver. One important way to get everyone on the same page is to establish metrics of success. Analytics are an important part of measuring success of web based projects, it can be one of the most illuminating tools at your disposal. It is important to trust your gut but you also have to read the numbers. </p>

            <h4>Audit</h4>
            <p>Many times clients already have a web presence, social presence, maybe even marketing. It is important to know what is already existing before going in and working on your project. Research your client!  What they do, their competitors, the market they work in, their target audience and existing customers. When a client approaches you looking for work I find having the content, at least samples or drafts of that in hand. Content will be needed in order to craft the best possible product. You need to really understand what you are working with! You may have to work with the client to prepare this content or find them help in doing so. Certain projects also require you to consider what the client is capable of maintaining and what resources they have available. This is especially true of content managed sites. The ultimate goal here is to document what we have available to us and what we plan to produce. </p>

            <h4>Content Strategy</h4>
            <p>Okay, so now we have gone through what we have and what we want to be. We need to evaluate the nuances of distributing this information. Persona is important with building a connection with your user. The design should reflect the tone and personality of the content. Identifying this early on is key. This feeds in heavily with the brand where you want to deliver consistent and targeted messaging. Some other consideration here are search engine optimization, how your content will be marketed digitally and distributed.</p>

            <h4>Content Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>If you are still lacking content at this point for your initial launch or deadline, time to kick it into high gear. If you wait to the end for the content it will cause delays and no one will be happy. You may need to help out the client with this process if they are having trouble on their own. </p>

            <h5>(to the designers)</h5>
            <p>The content building process is the time for you to understand your client and build trust by demonstrating your knowledge of your craft, their industry, their company and product. Another important goal here is to establish yourself as an authority. Letting the client hi-jack the creative process will see everyone lose. You will need this arsenal of information in order to make the most informed decisions and fight for what you believe (just be prepared to back it up). In the end you want to be a partner with your client as that is when the meaningful/good work happens. </p>

            <em>Ok lets talk a little bit about websites.</em>

            <h4>Sitemaps</h4>
            <p>The sitemap helps us figure out how we want to organize the content as a whole. A sitemap is a great visual tool to show the hierarchy/user paths of your site. The primary level of your sitemap essentially becomes the site navigation. Always consider how many clicks it will take to reach certain sections. I try to keep sites as shallow as possible, this prevents sites from becoming overly complicated. Best to keep these documents simple and too the point. </p>
