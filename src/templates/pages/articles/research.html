				<h3>1. Define Goals</h3>

				<p>
					We will analyze your products design effectiveness through an expert
					perspective and analysis of data. From these insights we will create a
					compelling and easy to understand document that can be shared
					internally or with other agencies. This document will define problem
					areas and practical actions that can be taken to increase usability.
					We will also explore a potential roadmap and methodology for
					validating changes.

						upgrade to a full account.
					</li>

						your product.
