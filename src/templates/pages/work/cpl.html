        <h4>Enviromental Signage.</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> The Cambridge Public Library wanted to create a
          new interior and exterior signage system for the newly renovated
          building and new building section.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> I worked as the Project Designer with the
          Principal Designer (Tom) to conceptualize and design the signage and
          wayfinding of the building using architectural drawings and virtual
          walkthroughs as references. This included everything from welcome
          signs, floor maps, restroom signs, even the numbers on the elevator
          jams. I choose the typography, photography, and visual styles used for
          the project. I drafted production ready artwork to send to
          fabrication, this included designing mounts, selecting materials, and
          demonstrating exact sign placement. I also created 3D/2D
          visualizations to present design work to the client for review.
