        <h4>Process allows for systemic and repeatable to approach to success.</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> The alumni magazine was looking for a design more
          inline with its magazine-style. Content varied month to month so they
          wanted to make sure the site would always appear with a desirable
          layout and that issues content. A unique part of this website is
          previous content would only be available through the archive. The
          website would very much be a digital magazine.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Challenge</strong> We had struggled to manage the wireframing
          and design phase in previous projects for RWD. Our clients wanted to see
          mockups in all screen size for all the pages we designed. 
          With this project I changed how we approached RWD designs as a company. I design a process in creating a process to limit the amount of static comps. I would design reusable HTML components and styles that would be used to layout all the pages not covered. This changed how we would approach building the sites and overall led to more efficent builds. This process also allowed for more iteration and time to be spent on design.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong>I was responsible for creating the sitemap, mobile-priority,
          wireframes, and working prototype. I produced all the front-end
          production code, much of which was recycled from the prototype.</p>

            I created this Content Inventory &mdash; to show at a block level
            the heirarchy of information for the page. We created a list of all
            possible blocks and used that to scaffold out all the page types.
            Types were assigned to blocks of similar functionality to display
            placements.

        <h5>UI Patterns</h5>

        <p>
          I wanted to allow flexibility in the feature list sections. No matter
          the number of articles the presentation would always be desirable.

        <h5>HTML Prototype</h5>
        <p>
          I designed a component template system that I used to create the
          prototype. We ended with 41 pages made with approx 30 components with
          about 100 variations. Below is a working version of that prototype,
          follow the orange dots for active links.
