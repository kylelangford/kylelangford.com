        <h4>Digital Magazine Publishing</h4>

        <p>
          My accomplishments for this project include crafting a process
          from research to development. I designed reusable components and
          list styles that were used to layout all the pages of the site. I
          was responsible for creating the sitemap, mobile-priority, layout
          wireframes, and working prototype. I also produced all the
          front-end production code, much of which was recycled from the
          prototype.

            I created this Content Inventory &mdash; to show at a block
            level the heirarchy of information for the page. We created a
            list of all possible blocks and used that to scaffold out all
            the page types. Types were assigned to blocks of similar
            functionality to display placements.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Component Patterns</h5>

         <p>
          I wanted to allow flexibility in the feature list sections. No
          matter the number of articles the presentation would always be
          desirable.
        </p>

        <div class="specimen">
          <img
            src="../assets/img/projects/paw/device-mockup-tablet.png"
            alt="Elephant at sunset"
            style="width: 80%;"
          />

        </div>

        <h5>HTML Prototype</h5>
        <p>
          I devised a simple template system that I used to create the
          prototype. We ended with 41 pages made with approx 30 components
          with about 100 variations. Below is a working version of that prototype, follow the orange dots for active links.
