          <strong>Ask</strong> Looking for a fresh new design and website PennStater contracted us to make it happen. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> Having consulted in the design phases, moving to development was a smooth process. For this project I took the develpment lead and worked with our backend developer Christian to delegate and build out the site. My main contribution was the frontend theme and site building. Worked on estimate and initial pitch.
