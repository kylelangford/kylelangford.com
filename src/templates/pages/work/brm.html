        <h4>Process Driven Design</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> Bally Ribbon Mills produces a wide variety of
          narrow woven fabrics, webbing, tapes and custom fabrication. They do
          confidential work for the government but also have public clients like
          NASA. They made the parachute for the mars rover. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Setting Goals</strong> Bally wanted a website to manage and showcase their product information and capabilities. I worked to give Bally an authoritative and clearly organized site and product library. Adam and I performed qualitative research to gather site goals and aesthetic taste. I produced the design work which included information architecture, branding, and web design. I implemented the site in Drupal 7.
        </p>

        <h5>Information Architecture</h5>

        <p>Part of my process is to audit the existing content and produce a content outline and original sitemap. Using our primary goals as a guide we will reorganize the sitemap making the content easy to find.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>Wireframes</h5>

        <p>In addition to the content audit I like to break down pages into components. In this case the existing site was very minimal. So we needed to show bally how we would present content, specifically on the homepage in addition to a product template. This is a good exercise to block out different page types which helps with creating the data schema as well as the final design. This site was designed before RWD so it only has desktop sizing.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>Branding</h5>
        <p>I like to use moodboards to hone in on the clients vision for the site without making a full set of comps. The goal is not to produce a final design but capture the essence of a look. In this case Bally Ribbon came to us with very little brand pressedence and relied on us to create a visual language for them.</p>
