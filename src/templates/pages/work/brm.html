        <h4>Narrow woven fabrics.</h4>

        <p>
          One of my first design projects at Brunello was for a company that
          produced narrow fabric and advanced composites for
          industrial/military application. It was important for Bally to be
          Modern and Authoritive. This design for Bally Ribbon Mills has
          held up well over the years, even longer than the site itself!
          This project used sitemaps, wireframes, style-tiles, and full-page
          mockups. I built the site in Drupal 7.
