        <h4>Drupal site design and development.</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> Bally Ribbon Mills produces a wide variety of
          narrow woven fabrics, webbing, tapes and custom fabrication. They do
          confidential work for the government but also have public clients like
          NASA. (Sidenote: They made the descent parachute for one of the Mars
          rovers). Bally wanted a Drupal website to manage and showcase their
          product information and capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> This was my first time as the design and
          development lead for a web project at Brunello. I worked with Adam
          Hoyle (Owner) to give Bally an authoritative and clearly laid out site
          that made connecting with clients easy compared to competitors. I
          produced the design work which included sitemaps, wireframes,
          moodboards, and full-page mockups. Site development was done by me
          using Drupal 7 CMS.
