          <strong>Ask</strong> A centralized content publishing platform for
          healthy articles, recipes, and coupons. The content api feeds
          microsites that can be customized in look and content. The Platform 
          also provides a suite of content creation tools, such as lineups, reporting,
          workflows, and project tracking. Originally called LMS this platform was built in Drupal 7 and has seen one major migration and rebasing to Drupal 8.

        <p>
          <strong>Iterate</strong> This is a long standing project where I started with the UI design, user research and theme development. Overtime that responsbility shifted to managing the platforms theming layer. We reguraly build and deploy microsites using the  base themes I built as well as create fully custom sites that take advantage or our data layer. Content can be packaged and sent to microsites and controlled from a centralized point. We designed and built admin themes and worflow tools to create content and reports. We continue to develop features and push the product into the future.
