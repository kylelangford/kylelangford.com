        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> A centralized content publishing platform for
          recipes, healthy articles, and coupons. The Platform needed to provide
          hosted microsites that can be customized in look and content. Content
          was targeted at healthcare plans looking to supplement their digitial
          communications and benefits. The Platform also needed to provide a
          suite of content creation tools, such as lineups, reporting,
          workflows, and project tracking.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> We created a powerful Drupal API and
          Multisite application that could handle the changing demands of a
          content publishing platform. We designed a flexible theme that is
          easily customizable and updatable. Content can be packaged and sent to
          microsites and controlled from a centralized point. We designed easy
          to use custom backend themes to create content and reports. We
          continue to develop features and push the product into the future.
