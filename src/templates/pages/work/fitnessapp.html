        <h4>HTML5 Video Magic</h4>

        <p>
          Elev8d Fitness app provided users with full-length video workouts
          as well as guided video playlists. The original Angular build was
          riddled with bugs and had a very confusing design. This was a
          webview app so that presented a lot of challenges with video
          playback. We were able to design a player that simplified the UI
          and allowed seamless playing. I focused on transitions and
          animation to give a more native app feel. This project was the
          first time I had worked with Angular v5 and typescript which made
          this challanging.
