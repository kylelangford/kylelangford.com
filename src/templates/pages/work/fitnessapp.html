        <h4>Angular Video Player</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask</strong> Elev8d Fitness was in trouble, they had a good
          idea but a terribly implemented web app. Elev8d provided users with a
          special type of guided workout as well as full-length video
          content. They needed a major refresh but at the same time needed sound functionality. Many of the features (Like pausing the video!) they wanted to implement were deemed "impossible" due to how the code was originally written.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Challenge</strong>  An important user hueretic is the visibility of system status and giving the user freedom to control the UI. In this case the original player suffered from not showing the user where in the workout and making it very difficult to move between sections which were linked to a timer.<p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> We were able to design a player that
          simplified the UI and provided the seamless playback experience that
          was expected. I provided technical leadership to design the
          functionality and UI of the video component. Jay's focus was
          integrating branding elements and Christian was rebuilding the video
          API service. I rebuilt the angular video player and playlist and designed the player UI, transitions and animations to give a more native app feel.</p>

        <h5>Video Player Demo</h5>

        <div class="stretch">
          <video controls width="100%" class="video-player">
            <source
              src="../assets/video/video-player-workout.webm"
              type="video/webm"
            />
            <source
              src="../assets/video/video-player-workout.mp4"
              type="video/mp4"
            />

          <strong>UX Audit</strong> In addition to the video player the web app had many usability problems. Part of our task was to perform a full UX audit. Our company had never done one so it was on me to define and scope out what a UX Audit would look like. After performing the audit with two other designers I designed and built a simple page to display all of our results and findings.</p>
