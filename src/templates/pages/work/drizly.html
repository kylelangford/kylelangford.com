        <h4>Design and Generate HTML Emails</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask </strong> Drizly needed help designing and producing
          emails in order to drive continuous traffic to their alcohol ordering
          web service. My partner and I consulted with them for some time,
          designing a reoccurring email and also helping code emails.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> There was a lot of commonalities in the
          emails we built. I proposed that we design a library of reusable
          templates based on their existing email designs. We boiled the emails
          down to a dozen or so components. I designed and built a UI for
          arranging these templates and populating them with content. This app
          would render the HTML in a preview panel and also allows you to export
          the generated HTML, which we would place into Litmus and eventually
          into ExactTarget.
        </p>
