        <h4>Design and Generate HTML Emails</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>Ask </strong> We had been coding emails for Drizly for several months. I designed a monthly calendar email and regularly built and designed HTML emails with the help of my partner Rachel Sorkin. We proposed a component based design system to help streamline their email production.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Outcome</strong> There was a lot of commonalities in the
          emails we built. I proposed that we design a library of reusable
          templates based on their existing email designs. We boiled the emails
          down to a dozen or so components. I designed and built a UI for
          arranging these templates and populating them with content. This app
          would render the HTML in a preview panel and also allows you to export
          the generated HTML, which we would place into Litmus and eventually
          into ExactTarget.
