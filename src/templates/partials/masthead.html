			<p>
				As for the value I bring to a project. I produce production ready code
				that scales and is secure, outstanding communication, detailed
				documentation and top notch support.
			</p>

			I am a frontend web developer, among other things. And I intend to write
			about that work here, occasionally — recording some portion of what I
			learn and think and do related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, The Web Platform,
			&c. About the Person My name is David Clark. Physically, I am located in
			Tucson, Arizona; virtually, I can be found on Github and Twitter. (I guess
			I’m also on LinkedIn.) And you can feel free to email me, if you’d like.
			About the Site If you’re curious how I made this site, one of these days I
			plan to write a little post about it. To summarize: Jekyll, Gulp, and
			Rework. Some icons on the site were made by Yannick and Icons8 from
			www.flaticon.com, licensed by CC BY 3.0.
