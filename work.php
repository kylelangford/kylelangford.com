          <h2>Working <br /> with Code</h2>
            <p>In regards to creating frontend interfaces working with codes seems a more logical approach that allows you to iterate and refine your work more in the course of a project. Working in photoshop or other graphic editing programs can be a good part of the creative process however and I frequently use these programs along side my text editor.</p>
